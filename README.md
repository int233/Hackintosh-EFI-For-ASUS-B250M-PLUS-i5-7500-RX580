[中文说明](README_ZH.md)

# # Introduction

Recently, Xianyu received a piece of RX580 for personal use. I have made integration and modification after referring to a lot of articles and other predecessors' EFI. Thank you.

No independent graphics card EFI, only added models, three code need to be generated to add.
Core graphics card platform ID: 59120000, just a simple patch to add some attributes of the device, can be regenerated if necessary.
